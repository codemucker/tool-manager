## Overview
This script is the engine for managing long-running background processes, or "services," that can be defined by plugins. It provides a centralized set of functions to handle the registration, starting, stopping, and listing of these services, allowing plugins to offer functionality that persists beyond a single command execution (e.g., a file watcher, a local web server).

## Design Philosophy
The service management system is designed to be robust and centrally managed. Plugins declare services by placing definition files (`.conf` or `.sh`) in a `service.d` directory. This library discovers these definitions during plugin loading.

-   **Registration:** When a plugin is enabled, the `_tm::service::add` function creates a symbolic link to the service definition file in a central directory (`$TM_PLUGINS_SERVICES_DIR`). This decouples the service's availability from the plugin's enabled status, making it easy to see all registered services in one place.
-   **Process Management:** When a service is started, its Process ID (PID) is stored in a corresponding file within `$TM_PLUGINS_PID_DIR`. This allows other commands to easily find and interact with the running process (e.g., to stop or check its status).
-   **Configuration over Convention:** Services are defined using `.conf` files, which are parsed to extract metadata like the start command, description, and auto-start behavior. This is more explicit and flexible than relying on filename conventions alone.

## Key Logic
-   **`_tm::service::add()`:** This function is called by `_tm::plugin::load` when a plugin containing a `service.d` directory is loaded. It takes the plugin details and the path to the service definition file, and creates a symlink in `$TM_PLUGINS_SERVICES_DIR`, effectively registering the service with the system.
-   **`_tm::service::start()`:** This function is the core of starting a service. It takes a service definition file, executes the `start()` command defined within it as a background process (`&`), captures the new process's PID (`$!`), and writes the PID and other metadata to a file in `$TM_PLUGINS_PID_DIR`.
-   **`_tm::service::stop()`:** (Partially implemented) This function is intended to find the PID file for a given service, read the PID, and use the `kill` command to terminate the process.
-   **`_tm::service::list_all()`:** Provides a complete overview of the service landscape by traversing both the registered services directory (`$TM_PLUGINS_SERVICES_DIR`) and the running process PID directory (`$TM_PLUGINS_PID_DIR`), printing their contents in a tree-like structure.
-   **`_tm::service::parse_service_conf()`:** Reads a `.conf` file using the `lib.io.conf.sh` library and populates a bash associative array with the service's properties, setting sensible defaults for values like `label` and `desc`.

## Usage
This is an internal library, primarily used by the `tm-service`, `tm-service-start`, and `tm-service-stop` user-facing commands, as well as by the plugin loading mechanism itself.

```bash
# A script like 'tm-service-start' would use this library
_tm::source::include @tm/lib.service.sh

# Call a function from this library
_tm::service::start "my-plugin" "/path/to/service.conf"
```
