## Overview
This script is the foundational library for the "spaces" feature, which appears to manage self-contained project environments. It provides the essential functions for interacting with space definition files, which are `.ini`-formatted files stored in the `$TM_SPACE_DIR`. The library handles finding these files, reading their contents into memory, and parsing them into a structured format.

## Design Philosophy
The library is designed around the concept of a "space file" (`.space.<guid>.ini`), which acts as the manifest for a given space. Each space is identified by a unique key and a GUID. The functions are built to retrieve and interpret these files, providing a consistent way for higher-level scripts to get information about a specific space. The use of an associative array (`local -A space`) to hold the details of a loaded space provides a structured and easily accessible in-memory representation.

## Key Logic
-   **`_tm::space::file::find_all()`:** Scans the `$TM_SPACE_DIR` for all files matching the `.space.*.ini` pattern and returns a list of their paths. This is used for listing all available spaces.
-   **`_tm::space::file::get_by_key()`:** Finds a specific space file by searching all space files for one that contains a matching `key=` value. This allows for user-friendly, name-based lookups.
-   **`_tm::space::file::get_by_guid()`:** Finds a specific space file directly using its globally unique identifier, which is embedded in the filename. This is the most direct and unambiguous way to reference a space.
-   **`_tm::space::file::read_array()`:** This is the primary parsing function. It takes a path to a space file and a reference to an associative array. It uses `_tm::file::env::read` to parse the `.ini` file into the array and then populates additional, calculated fields like `id` (an alias for `guid`), `space_file` (the path to the definition file), and `dir` (the default working directory for the space).
-   **`_tm::space::print_info()`:** A simple utility function that iterates over a loaded space's associative array and prints its key-value pairs for debugging or informational purposes.
-   **`_tm::space::launch_by_file()`:** An incomplete function intended to be the entry point for activating or "launching" a space. It currently reads the space file but stops short of implementing the launch logic.

## Usage
This is an internal library used by the user-facing `tm-space-*` commands.

```bash
# A script like 'tm-space-info' would use this library
_tm::source::include @tm/lib.space.sh

# Find a space by its key
local space_file="$(_tm::space::file::get_by_key 'my-project')"

# Read its details into an array
local -A my_space_details
_tm::space::file::read_array my_space_details "$space_file"

# Print the details
_tm::space::print_info my_space_details
```
