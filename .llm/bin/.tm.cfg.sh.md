## Overview
This script is a core library responsible for handling all configuration management within the `.tool-manager` ecosystem. It provides a set of `_tm::cfg::*` functions for getting and setting configuration values, which are primarily stored in `.env` files. It also introduces a newer, `yq`-based system (`_tm::cfg2::*`) for parsing structured YAML configuration specifications (`cfg.spec.yaml`) and generating shell-based configuration loaders.

## Design Philosophy
The library is designed to provide a unified interface for configuration, abstracting away the underlying storage mechanism. It supports multiple configuration scopes (global, tool-manager, user, and per-plugin) to allow for flexible and layered configuration. The newer `cfg2` functions represent a shift towards a more structured and self-documenting configuration approach, where a YAML file defines the available keys, their types, defaults, and descriptions. This allows for automatic generation of configuration loading scripts and can be used to build interactive configuration prompts. The use of `envsubst` allows for dynamic configuration values based on the user's environment.

## Key Logic
### Legacy Configuration (`_tm::cfg::*`)
-   **`_tm::cfg::get_cfg_editor` & `_tm::cfg::get_editor`:** These functions retrieve the user's preferred command-line editor (`code`, `vim`, etc.) from the `tm` configuration, with sensible fallbacks to `TM_DIR_EDITOR` and `EDITOR` environment variables. This is used by commands like `tm-edit-cfg`.
-   The core get/set logic is primarily handled by the sourced `lib.file.env.sh` library, which reads and writes to `.env` files.

### Structured YAML Configuration (`_tm::cfg2::*`)
-   **Dependency Check:** The script first checks for the existence of `envsubst` and `yq`, as they are critical for this functionality.
-   **`_tm::cfg2::plugin_init`:** Reads a plugin's `cfg.spec.yaml` file, parses the defined keys using `yq`, expands any environment variables in the `default` and `note` fields using `envsubst`, and then calls `_env_cfg_key` to set the configuration for the current session.
-   **`_tm::cfg2::__generate_sh_from_plugin_yaml`:** This is the core generator function. It reads a `cfg.spec.yaml` file and writes a corresponding `.sh` file (e.g., `cfg.sh`). This output script contains a series of `_env_cfg_key` calls, effectively creating a static, sourceable representation of the plugin's configuration that can be loaded quickly.
-   **`_tm::cfg2::plugin_generate_sh_cfg_file`:** A wrapper function that takes a plugin ID, finds its YAML specification file, and calls the generator to create the `cfg.sh` file in the appropriate cache directory.

## Usage
This is a library and is not called directly. Other scripts source it to use its functions.

```bash
# Another script sourcing this library
_tm::source::include @tm/lib.cfg.sh

# Using a function from the library
local editor="$(_tm::cfg::get_editor)"
"$editor" /path/to/some/file
```

The `cfg2` functions are used by the plugin loading mechanism to prepare a plugin's environment before its scripts are executed.
