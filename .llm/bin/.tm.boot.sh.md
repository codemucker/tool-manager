## Overview
This script is the central nervous system of the `.tool-manager`. It is sourced once during shell startup (e.g., from `.bashrc`) and is responsible for setting up the entire `tm` execution environment. Its key duties include defining global constants, establishing the directory structure, sourcing essential libraries, and providing the core functions (`_tm::boot::init`, `_tm::boot::load`, `_tm::boot::reload`) that govern the lifecycle of the tool-manager and its plugins.

## Design Philosophy
The script is designed to be the single source of truth for the environment's configuration. It follows a "source-once" pattern to prevent re-initialization and uses a clear, namespaced function structure (`_tm::boot::*`). It establishes a comprehensive set of `TM_*` environment variables based on the XDG Base Directory Specification, ensuring a clean and predictable file system layout. The logic is separated into distinct functions for initialization (`init`), loading plugins (`load`), and refreshing the environment (`reload`), promoting modularity and maintainability.

## Key Logic
1.  **Guard Clause:** The script starts with a guard to ensure it's only sourced once per shell session.
2.  **Core Constants & Paths:** It defines read-only constants (`__TM_*`) and exports fundamental path variables (`TM_HOME`, `TM_BIN`, `TM_LIB_BASH`).
3.  **Initial Library Sourcing:** It immediately sources `lib.log.sh` and `lib.source.sh` so that logging and sourcing utilities are available for the rest of the bootstrap process.
4.  **`_tm::boot::init()`:** This is the main initialization function, executed at the end of the script.
    - It defines all `TM_*` directory paths for cache, config, state, and plugins, following XDG standards.
    - It creates these directories on the file system if they don't exist.
    - It adds the `tm` binary directories (`$TM_BIN`, `$TM_PLUGINS_BIN_DIR`) to the system `PATH`.
    - It sets up an event listener (`_tm::boot:__event_callback`) if tracing is enabled.
5.  **`_tm::boot::load()`:** This function is responsible for activating the plugins. It adds the plugin wrapper scripts to the `PATH` and then calls `_tm::plugins::load_all_enabled` to source the environment files of all enabled plugins.
6.  **`_tm::boot::reload()`:** This function provides a mechanism to refresh the entire `tm` environment. It clears caches, regenerates plugin wrappers, and re-runs the `_tm::boot::load` sequence.
7.  **Error Trapping:** Includes a `_tm::trap::error` function to provide detailed stack traces upon script errors, aiding in debugging.

## Usage
This script is not intended for direct execution. It is sourced by the user's shell profile to initialize the tool-manager.

```bash
# In ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile
source "/path/to/.tool-manager/bin/.tm.boot.sh"
```

The functions it provides are used internally by other `tm-*` commands:
```bash
# Example of another script using a boot function
tm-reload # This command calls _tm::boot::reload
```
