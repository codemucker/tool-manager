## Overview
This script acts as the high-level orchestrator for the entire plugin system. While `.tm.plugin.sh` deals with individual plugins, this library manages them in aggregate. It is responsible for discovering which plugins are available, installed, or enabled; for installing new plugins from a registry or a git repository; and for performing bulk actions like loading all enabled plugins at startup or regenerating all their command wrappers.

## Design Philosophy
The script is designed as a manager layer that delegates single-plugin operations to `.tm.plugin.sh`. It introduces the concept of a plugin "registry," a set of `.conf` files that define available plugins and their repository locations. This decouples the tool-manager from any specific set of plugins, making it highly extensible. Functions are clearly separated by their scope: finding plugins, installing them, and managing their collective state.

## Key Logic
1.  **Discovery (`find_*` functions):**
    -   `_tm::plugins::find_all_enabled_dirs`: Finds active plugins by listing the symbolic links in `$TM_PLUGINS_ENABLED_DIR`.
    -   `_tm::plugins::find_all_installed_dirs`: Finds all downloaded plugins by scanning the subdirectories of `$TM_PLUGINS_INSTALL_DIR`.
    -   `_tm::plugins::find_all_available_plugin_ids`: Finds all plugins listed in the registry (`.conf`) files, providing a list of what *can* be installed.

2.  **Installation (`_tm::plugins::install`):**
    -   This function acts as a dispatcher. If the input argument looks like a Git URL, it calls `_tm::plugins::install_from_git`.
    -   Otherwise, it calls `_tm::plugins::install_from_registry`, which searches the `.conf` files for a matching plugin entry.
    -   The private `_tm::plugins::__clone_and_install` function performs the actual `git clone` operation and, upon success, calls `tm-plugin-enable` to activate the new plugin.

3.  **Loading & Reloading:**
    -   `_tm::plugins::load_all_enabled`: This is a critical startup function. It gets the list of all enabled plugins and iterates through them, calling `_tm::plugin::load` for each one to source its environment.
    -   `_tm::plugins::reload_all_enabled`: A convenience function to refresh the environment by resetting the loaded flag and re-running `load_all_enabled`.

4.  **Wrapper Script Management:**
    -   `_tm::plugins::regenerate_all_wrapper_scripts`: A key function for maintaining the command namespace. It first calls `_tm::plugins::remove_all_wrappers` to wipe the `$TM_PLUGINS_BIN_DIR` and then iterates through every enabled plugin, calling `_tm::plugin::regenerate_wrapper_scripts` to recreate the command wrappers. This ensures the `PATH` is always in sync with the enabled plugins.

5.  **Iteration (`_tm::plugins::foreach_available_callback`):**
    -   A powerful iterator that reads all registry files and invokes a provided callback function for each available plugin definition. This is the engine behind commands like `tm-plugin-ls --available`.

## Usage
This is an internal library and is not meant for direct execution. It is sourced and used by user-facing commands to perform their actions.
-   `tm-plugin-install` uses `_tm::plugins::install`.
-   `tm-plugin-ls` uses the `find_*` and `foreach_*` functions.
-   `tm-reload` uses `_tm::plugins::reload_all_enabled`.
-   The main `.tm.boot.sh` script uses `_tm::plugins::load_all_enabled` during shell startup.
