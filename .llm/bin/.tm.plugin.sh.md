## Overview
This script is a cornerstone of the plugin management system. It contains the essential functions for handling individual plugins. Its responsibilities range from loading a plugin's environment into the current shell, to creating and removing the symlinks that signify an "enabled" state, to dynamically generating the wrapper scripts that make a plugin's commands available on the system `PATH`.

## Design Philosophy
The script is designed around the concept of a "plugin associative array," a bash data structure that holds all the metadata for a single plugin (e.g., its name, installation directory, enabled path). Functions take this array by reference (`local -n`) to operate on specific plugins. The logic is carefully structured to be robust, with checks for existence and state (e.g., is it already enabled?) before performing actions. It also isolates plugin loading into a subshell to prevent plugins from polluting the global environment or interfering with each other, enhancing stability.

## Key Logic
1.  **`_tm::plugin::load()`:** This is the heart of the script.
    -   It takes a plugin array as input.
    -   It runs in a subshell `()` to isolate the plugin's environment.
    -   Inside the subshell, it exports crucial environment variables like `TM_PLUGIN_HOME` and `TM_PLUGIN_ID` so the plugin knows its own context.
    -   It sources the plugin's configuration (`cfg.sh`) and environment files (`.bashrc`, `bashrc.d/*`).
    -   It discovers and registers any services defined in the plugin's `service.d` directory.
    -   It warns the user if a plugin attempts to modify the `PATH` or create aliases, as these changes will not persist outside the subshell.

2.  **`_tm::plugin::enable()`:**
    -   Creates a symlink from the plugin's installation directory to the central `plugins/enabled` directory.
    -   Calls `_tm::plugin::__generate_wrapper_scripts` to make the plugin's commands available.
    -   Executes the optional `plugin-requires` and `plugin-enable` scripts to handle dependencies and setup tasks.
    -   Links any shared libraries from the plugin's `lib-shared` directory into the central `plugins/lib` directory.

3.  **`_tm::plugin::disable()`:**
    -   Executes the optional `plugin-disable` script for cleanup.
    -   Removes the plugin's symlink from the `plugins/enabled` directory.
    -   Removes the generated wrapper scripts.

4.  **`_tm::plugin::__generate_wrapper_scripts()`:**
    -   Finds all executable scripts with a shebang (`#!`) in the plugin's `bin` and `src` directories.
    -   For each script found, it creates a new "wrapper" script in `$TM_PLUGINS_BIN_DIR`.
    -   This wrapper is a simple script that calls the `tm-run-script` internal command, passing along the plugin's context (ID, directories) and the path to the real script to be executed. This indirection is what allows the `tm` environment to be set up correctly before the plugin's code runs.

## Usage
This is a library and is not called directly. It is sourced by other `tm-*` scripts that perform plugin operations.

```bash
# A script like 'tm-plugin-enable' would use this library
_tm::source::include @tm/lib.plugin.sh

declare -A my_plugin
_tm::parse::plugin my_plugin "my-plugin-name"

# Call a function from this library
_tm::plugin::enable my_plugin
```
