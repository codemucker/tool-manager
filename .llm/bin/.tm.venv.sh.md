## Overview
This script is the heart of the `.tool-manager`'s virtual environment system. It is responsible for interpreting the dependency requirements of a script (as parsed by `.tm.venv.directives.sh`), creating a tailored virtual environment for it, and then executing the script within that environment. It supports multiple "providers" for creating these environments, including Python's standard `venv`, the faster `uv`, and `docker` for full containerization.

## Design Philosophy
The script is designed to be a flexible and intelligent execution engine. Its core philosophy is "analyze once, run many times." It heavily utilizes caching to avoid the expensive process of re-analyzing a script's dependencies and recreating its environment on every execution.

-   **Caching:** When a script is first run, its contents are checksummed. The script's `@require` directives are parsed and stored in a cache file named after the checksum. The resulting virtual environment path and provider details are also cached. On subsequent runs, if the script's checksum hasn't changed, the cached information is used directly, making execution much faster.
-   **Provider Abstraction:** The `__tm::venv::__invoke` function acts as a dispatcher, routing the execution to a specific handler (`__invoke_in_uv_env`, `__invoke_in_python_venv`, `__invoke_in_docker`) based on the `venv:provider` directive. This makes the system extensible to new environment technologies.
-   **Path Calculation:** The `__tm::venv::__calc_venv_dir` function uses a deterministic algorithm to decide where a virtual environment should be stored. It can create environments per-plugin, per-script, or a single one for the tool-manager itself, based on the script's location. This keeps environments organized and avoids conflicts.

## Key Logic
1.  **`__tm::venv::run()`:** The main public entry point. It takes a script path and its arguments, then calls `__calc_env` to prepare the environment details and `__invoke` to execute it.

2.  **`__tm::venv::__calc_env()`:**
    -   Calculates a checksum of the target script file.
    -   Checks for a `.cache` file corresponding to the script's path. If the cache is valid (checksum matches), it loads the pre-calculated environment details.
    -   If the cache is invalid or missing, it calls `_tm::venv::extract_directives` to parse the script's header.
    -   It iterates through the parsed directives, populating an associative array with details like the `venv_provider`, `venv_type`, `python_version`, and any package requirements (`pip`, `apt`, etc.).
    -   It determines the path for the virtual environment using `__calc_venv_dir`.
    -   Finally, it writes all the calculated details back to the `.cache` file for future runs.

3.  **`__tm::venv::__invoke()`:**
    -   Acts as a `case` statement-based dispatcher. It reads the `venv_provider` from the environment details array.
    -   It calls the appropriate `__invoke_in_*_env` function, passing the environment details and the script arguments.

4.  **`__invoke_in_*_env()` functions:**
    -   **`..._in_uv_env` / `..._in_python_venv`:** These functions ensure the virtual environment directory exists, create it if necessary (using `uv venv` or `python -m venv`), install any required `pip` dependencies from the generated `requirements.txt` file, `source` the `activate` script to bring the venv into the `PATH`, and then execute the target script.
    -   **`..._in_docker`:** This function pulls the specified Docker image, or builds a new one from a `Dockerfile` if provided. It then uses `docker run` to execute the script inside the container, carefully mounting the necessary host directories (like `$TM_HOME`, the script's location, etc.) as read-only volumes and passing in essential `TM_*` environment variables.
