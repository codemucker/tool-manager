## Overview
This script serves as a common header for most, if not all, executable scripts in `.tool-manager`. Its primary purpose is to enforce a consistent, robust execution environment by setting standard shell options and enabling a global error trap.

## Design Philosophy
The script is designed to be minimal and universally applicable. It enforces a "fail-fast" policy (`set -Eeuo pipefail`) to prevent scripts from continuing in an unpredictable state after an error occurs. By sourcing this single file, script authors can easily adopt best practices for error handling and environment setup without duplicating code.

## Key Logic
1.  **`set -Eeuo pipefail`**: This is the most critical part of the script.
    -   `e`: Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
    -   `E`: Ensures that `ERR` traps are inherited by shell functions, subshells, and commands.
    -   `u`: Treat unset variables as an error when substituting.
    -   `o pipefail`: The return value of a pipeline is the status of the last command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if no command exited with a non-zero status.
2.  **Sourcing Common Libraries:** It sources `.tm.common.sh` and `lib.common.sh` to make basic utility functions available to the script.
3.  **`_trap_error`:** This function call (defined in `.tm.boot.sh` but which calls a handler in `lib.error.sh`) sets up a global `trap` on the `ERR` signal. This means that if any command fails (due to `set -e`), a centralized error handling function (`_tm::error::trap_handler`) will be called, which typically prints a stack trace, providing excellent debugging information.

## Usage
This script is not executed directly. Instead, it is sourced at the beginning of other executable scripts.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# My custom tool-manager script

# Source the common script setup
source "$TM_BIN/.tm.script.sh"

# ... rest of the script logic ...
```

## Related
-   `.llm/bin/.tm.boot.sh.md` (Where `_trap_error` is defined)
-   `.llm/lib-shared/tm/bash/lib.error.sh.md` (Where the `_tm::error::trap_handler` function, called by the trap, is defined)
-   Almost all other executable scripts in the `bin` directory will source this file.
