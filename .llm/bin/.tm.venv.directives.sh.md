## Overview
This script is a specialized parser that scans the initial comment block of a script file for `@require` directives. These directives are a form of metadata that declare the script's dependencies, such as the language runtime (e.g., `python`, `node`) or specific packages. The script's main purpose is to extract these declarations so that the `.tool-manager` can automatically create and activate the correct virtual environment before executing the script.

## Design Philosophy
The script is designed as a focused, line-by-line parser. It operates on a simple, clear convention: directives must be in comments (`#` or `//`) at the top of the file and must follow the format `@require:<key> <value>`. This makes the dependency declarations human-readable and easy to embed directly within the scripts that need them. The parser is built to be robust, stopping at the first line of actual code to avoid accidentally misinterpreting the body of the script. It also intelligently extracts the runner from the shebang (`#!`) line as a primary hint for the environment type.

## Key Logic
1.  **`_tm::venv::__parse_directives()`:** This is the core parsing engine.
    -   It takes a file path and a reference to a bash array as input.
    -   It reads the file line by line from the beginning.
    -   It first looks for a shebang line (`#!...`). If found, it extracts the interpreter (e.g., `python`, `bash`) and adds it to the results as a `hashbang=` directive.
    -   It then checks subsequent lines for the pattern `@require:<key> <value>` within comments.
    -   For each match, it extracts the key and value and adds a `<key>=<value>` string to the output array.
    -   The parsing process stops as soon as it encounters a line that is not a comment, a shebang, or empty, ensuring it only processes the header.

2.  **`_tm::venv::extract_directives()`:** This is the main public function.
    -   It calls `_tm::venv::__parse_directives()` to get the raw list of directives.
    -   It performs some post-processing logic. Crucially, if a `venv:provider=` directive is not explicitly found, it attempts to infer one from the `hashbang=` directive (e.g., if `hashbang=python`, it adds `venv:provider=python`).
    -   It can either print the resulting directives to standard output or write them to a specified output file.

3.  **`_tm::venv::__has_directives()`:** A simple, fast helper function that quickly checks the first 50 lines of a file for the string `@require:` to determine if a full parse is even necessary, serving as a potential optimization.

## Usage
This is an internal library, primarily used by the virtual environment management system (`.tm.venv.sh`) and the script runner (`tm-run-script`) to prepare the execution context for a script.

```bash
# A script like 'tm-run-script' would use this library
_tm::source::include @tm/lib.venv.directives.sh

local script_to_run="/path/to/some/script.py"
local -a detected_directives

# Parse the script and populate the array
_tm::venv::__parse_directives "$script_to_run" detected_directives

# Now the venv system can inspect 'detected_directives'
# to build the correct environment.
# for directive in "${detected_directives[@]}"; do ...
```
