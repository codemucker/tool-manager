## Overview
This script is a lightweight library for miscellaneous utility functions that don't fit into a more specific category (like `lib.path.sh` or `lib.log.sh`). It is intended to be a collection of simple, reusable helpers.

## Design Philosophy
The script adheres to the principle of keeping libraries small and focused. It contains only broadly applicable functions. The `_tm::util::*` namespace is used to prevent conflicts with other functions.

## Key Logic
-   **`_tm::util::save_rm_file()`:** This function safely removes a file. It first checks if the file exists and is a regular file (`-f`) before attempting to delete it with `rm -f`. If the deletion fails, it issues a warning (`_warn`) but does not exit the script, making it a "safe" delete operation.

## Usage
This is a library and is not called directly. Other scripts source it to use its functions.

```bash
# Another script sourcing this library
_tm::source::include @tm/lib.common.sh

# Using a function from the library
local temp_file="/tmp/my_temp_file"
touch "$temp_file"
# ... do something with the file ...
_tm::util::save_rm_file "$temp_file"
```
