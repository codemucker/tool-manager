# Developer & Experimental Scripts (`bin-dev`)

This directory contains scripts that are for development, testing, and experimental purposes.

## Key Characteristics
- **Volatile:** The scripts here are considered works-in-progress and may change frequently or be removed without notice.
- **Developer-Focused:** These are not end-user commands but rather tools to aid in the development and testing of the Tool Manager framework itself.
- **Can Be Ignored:** For tasks related to the core functionality or maintenance of the Tool Manager, the contents of this directory can generally be ignored.

Do not rely on these scripts for production or stable workflows. They are not subject to the same standards of stability and documentation as the core `bin` and `lib-shared` components.
