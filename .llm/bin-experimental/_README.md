# Experimental Scripts (`bin-experimental`)

This directory contains scripts that are highly experimental, unstable, or incomplete.

## Key Characteristics
- **Volatile:** The scripts here are considered works-in-progress and may change frequently or be removed without notice.
- **Unstable:** These scripts are not guaranteed to work and should not be used for any critical tasks.
- **Can Be Ignored:** For all standard development, maintenance, or usage tasks, the contents of this directory should be ignored.

Do not rely on these scripts for any purpose. They are not subject to the documentation, stability, or testing standards of the rest of the codebase.
